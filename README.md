Transport Fever 2 Mod that adds variants of the stock highways with specific speeds.

The MPH (regular) version includes:
* 2-lane, 2-way highway @ 55, 60, 65, 70 MPH
* 2-lane, 1-way highway @ 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85 MPH
* 3-lane, 1-way highway @ 55, 60, 65, 70, 75 MPH
* 1-lane, 1-way highway/ramp @ 55 MPH

The KM/H version includes:
* 2-lane, 2-way highway @ 90, 100, 110 KM/H (80 provided by stock highway)
* 2-lane, 1-way highway @ 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140 KM/H (80 provided by stock highway)
* 3-lane, 1-way highway @ 80, 90, 110, 120 KM/H (100 provided by stock highway)
* 1-lane, 1-way highway/ramp @ 80 KM/H

I also have a standalone 2-lane 1-way highway with (basically) unlimited speed at 999 KM/H (620 MPH).

Recommended to use this with my [Faster Car Speeds mod](https://github.com/ThePotatoGuy/transf2-faster-car-speeds).
